# DiceRoll
This is a Small Dice Roll game which I developed using python. 
The user is prompted to press "y" to play the game. 
When the game is started. The numbers are generated randomly for the user and the computer. If the user has a greater number than the computer, user wins, and vice versa.
There are a total of 6 rounds, when pressed "y" the six rounds complete showing results for each of the round and a summary showing the report that who won and how many rounds.
